            <h3 class="h3_style_for_whitness_background">Who i am</h3>
            <p>
              I am a 23-year-old woman. In life I am a curious person, I like to learn new things. <br>I also have a very creative mind and a very logical person. From an early age I was quickly drawn to technology. It's a very large and diverse field with a lot to learn. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Around the age of 12 I played a little with html and css, unfortunately for various reasons I had to drop out of this fantastic world!
              <br>
                But growing up this world always called me to come back to it. So I took over the code, a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, I got interested in the network, the system and the programming.<br> So I acquired a lot of knowledge but not deep enough in each area. It is for this reason that I am looking for a place where I could deepen all this knowledge.<br>

        <div class="flex_center_column">
          <h3 class="h3_style_for_whitness_background">My background</h3>
          <p>
            As I said before, I became interested in the computer world at a very young age.<br>
            So I went back to it several times but at the time I didn't have the right method to learn, I hadn't yet found the right balance between theory and practice. <br>I was lost a lot of times in front of my editor having all the theory in mind but not knowing how to start my program, yet I always had a lot of ideas and imagination! Going back and forth in programming I began to understand how to do it.<br>
            I started with small projects, then with my too much ambition I wanted to do big projects but I hadn't really practiced enough little things before all that!
            So today I started again with the right methods and good practices!

            My experience of beCode in Liege
          </h3>
          <p>
            beCode was a great experience, I was able to collaborate with great people, it was a good experience to learn to work in a team. <br>Sometimes group projects were more stressful than single projects because you don't want to put the group behind on project deadlines. I was able to do small projects, in html and css, then JavaScript and then I started in React.<br>
            Because of the distance, the group manager preferred to end my contract, which I experienced a little badly because I already had the papers to sign my internship which I was going to start in March 2022.
            Following this disappointment, I felt a bit discouraged and stopped the code for a while. But my heart didn't agree with this choice so I took back one of the things I love the most, this time I know that even if a few things like this happen it doesn't question my skills .

            <p>
              My experience is not only based on certain languages or libraries. I've always been interested in hacking, I see it as a puzzle where you have to find all the pieces to be able to understand how things work. So I touched a bit on the network with the OSI and TCP/IP models. I was also able to meet the peer-to-peer which is very interesting on certain points. I also tame software such as Nmap, metasploit. After I understood that to complete my suitcase I had to become a very good developer. So I did some C after I got interested in the web with HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT. Then in the back-end with nodejs, etc... For Linux I dove a bit in the kernel and learned to tame it and I'm not so bad at it now sometimes I even do small variables in Bash.
I like to understand the deep and complete functioning of things and I always look further afield.
